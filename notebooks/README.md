# Noteboooks

These notebooks are the main interface of the project.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: We recommend to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#)

:small_orange_diamond:This is because it is very easy to clone the repository and download the different word embeddings in the Colab machine.

:white_check_mark: Also because there are some nice features to make the notebooks more interactive


To open the notebooks in google colab and run them, just go to the notebook and click on the badge ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) on top of the notebook. This will allow you to work on a copy of it.


:small_orange_diamond: All the tests were done using Google Colab
